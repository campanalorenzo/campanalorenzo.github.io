  abstract = {The thesis focuses on the dynamics of anisotropic particles in turbulence exploiting 
  stochastic Lagrangian methods. The development of models that reach an acceptable   
  compromise between simplicity and accuracy and that can be used as predictive tools in industrial 
  computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is needed for progressing in the field of medical, 
  environmental and industrial processes. A stochastic orientation model is studied in 
  two-dimensional turbulent flow with homogeneous shear; the results are compared with direct 
  numerical simulations (DNS). We look for analytical results, by scrutinising the effect of the 
  anisotropies and by extending the notion of rotational dynamics in the stochastic framework. The 
  two-dimensional model is then extended to the three-dimensional case. We introduce a numerical 
  scheme which is able to to preserve the dynamics at reasonable computational costs and we 
  analyse its convergence. We develop a scheme of splitting decomposition of the stochastic 
  differential equations (SDE), in order to overcome the typical instability problems of the 
  Euler--Maruyama method; we obtain a mean-square strong convergence of order 1/2 and a weak 
  convergence of order 1. Finally, the model and  the numerical scheme are implemented in an 
  industrial CFD code (Code Saturne) and they are used to study the orientational and rotational 
  behaviour of anisotropic inertia-free particles in a turbulent channel flow. The stochastic  
  Lagrangian model for the orientation in the CFD code reproduces with some limits the orientation 
  and rotation statistics of the DNS. The results obtained on the orientation and rotation of 
  aspherical particles in turbulence give new insight into large scale motions both, in 
  two-dimensional space of interest for geophysical flows, and in three-dimensional industrial 
  applications.}

  pdf = {MasterThesis_Campana_Lorenzo.pdf},
  abstract = {The superhydrophobic surfaces (SHSs) were initially inspired by the unique 
  water-repellent properties of the lotus leaf and can be employed to produce drag reduction in 
  turbulent flows. The effects of a SHS consist on micro-grooves which can entrap gas pockets 
  when sub-merged in the water, i.e. at the groove an interface liquid-gas with a no zero velocity 
  is present. In this work, direct numerical simulations (DNS) are used to investigate the 
  drag-reducing performance of SHS in a turbulent pipe flow. The configuration of SHS influences 
  the drag reduction within the pipe. The drag appears reduced in the SHS cases with respect to the 
  smooth classical case. This effect strongly depends on the geometrical features of the surfaces. 
  The increase of drag reduction is remarkable in the cases with a large groove width. To 
  understand the phenomena linked to this mechanism, the turbulent vortical structures are studied. 
  These last are significantly modified compared to the smooth case. The result obtained in this 
  work underlines that the contribution of the Reynolds stress within the pipe rises with the width of 
  groove, providing a negative contribution to the drag reduction. This effect is exceeded by the 
  contribution of the slip velocity at the wall. SHS technology represents an emergent application in 
  many fields of research and in a broad spectrum of industrial and everyday life applications.}

  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
