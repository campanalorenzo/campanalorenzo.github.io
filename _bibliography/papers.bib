  abstract  = {The complex behaviour of inertialess rod-shaped particles embedded in a 
              two-dimensional turbulent flow, with homogeneous shear, is studied. We introduce a Lagrangian 
              stochastic model for the rods angular dynamics. It consists in superposing a short-correlated 
              random component to the steady large-scale mean shear, and can be thereby integrated 
              analytically. Within the model, an effective anisotropic correlation tensor is introduced, to properly 
              account for the effect of the mean shear onto the Lagrangian statistics of the turbulent velocity 
              gradients. Then, single-time orientation statistics obtained from DNS, are compared with the 
              models results derived from the semi-analytical expression for the stationary distribution of the 
              folded angle. We propose an alternative definition of tumbling rate applicable  to diffusive 
              dynamics, in terms of the stationary probability flux of the rods unfolded angle, to address the 
              two-time statistics of the rods orientation. While the complex behaviour observed in the DNS 
              shows a non-Gaussian distribution of the unfolded angle in a diffusive regime, the diffusion model 
              is intended to provide a reasonable qualitative response, even if it is not designed to reproduce 
              such a behaviour.},

  abstract  = {In this work we present a stochastic Lagrangian model, 
              for the orientation of non-spherical particle for a three dimensional case. This model will be 
              coupled with the stochastic classical hybrid Eulerian/Lagrangian for the description of the

              numerical method for the non-linear stochastic differential equation (SDE) present in the model 
              (for which globally Lipschitz condition fails); our goal is to preserve the geometric features hidden 
              in this system and to obtain convergent schemes. The analysis will be followed by the application

  title        = {A Lagrangian stochastic model for rod orientation in turbulent flows},
  abstract     = {Suspension of anisotropic particles can be found in various applications, e.g. 
                  industrial manufacturing processes or natural phenomena (micro-organism locomotion, ice crystal 
                  formation in clouds). Microscopic ellipsoidal bodies suspended in a turbulent fluid flow rotate in 
                  response to the velocity gradient of the flow. Understanding their orientation is important since it can 
                  affect the optical or rheological properties of the suspension (e.g. polymeric fluids). In this work, the 
                  orientation dynamics of rod-like tracer particles, i.e. long ellipsoidal particles (in the limit to infinity of 
                  the aspect-ratio) is studied. The size of the rod is assumed smaller than the Kolmogorov length scale 
                  but sufficiently large that its Brownian motion need not be considered. As a result, the local flow 
                  around a particle can be considered as inertia-free and Stokes flow solutions can be used to relate 
                  particle rotational dynamics to the local velocity gradient tensor {$A$}. 
                  The orientation of a rod is described as the normalized solution of the linear ordinary differential 
                  equation for the separation vector {$r$} between two fluid tracers. Separation evolves under 
                  the action of the velocity gradient tensor. Simultaneously, a re-normalization procedure 
                  is introduced to obtain the unit-vector p aligned with the rod. In this frame, the 
                  rod orientation is described by a Lagrangian stochastic model, assuming that cumulative effects of 
                  the velocity gradient tensor on the observation time interval fluctuate with a Gaussian distribution. 
                  Indeed, cumulative velocity gradient fluctuations are here represented by a white-noise tensor such 
                  that it preserves the incompressibility condition. Large observation timescale (overall objective of 
                  the work) justifies the Gaussian distribution hypotheses, with a decorrelation timescale equal to the 
                  Kolmogorov one. Finally, the Lagrangian stochastic model is tested in the case of homogeneous 
                  isotropic turbulence.},

  title        = {Stochastic modelling of non-spherical particles in turbulence},
  abstract     = {The thesis focuses on the dynamics of anisotropic particles in turbulence exploiting stochastic Lagrangian methods. 
                  The development of models that reach an acceptable compromise between simplicity and accuracy and that can be used 
                  as predictive tools in industrial computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is needed for progressing in the field of medical, 
                  environmental and industrial processes. A stochastic orientation model is studied in two-dimensional turbulent flow 
                  with homogeneous shear; the results are compared with direct numerical simulations (DNS).
                  We look for analytical results, by scrutinising the effect of the anisotropies and by extending the notion of rotational 
                  dynamics in the stochastic framework. The two-dimensional model is then extended to the three-dimensional case. 
                  We introduce a numerical scheme which is able to to preserve the dynamics at reasonable computational costs 
                  and we analyse its convergence. We develop a scheme of splitting decomposition of the stochastic differential 
                  equations (SDE), in order to overcome the typical instability problems of the Euler-Maruyama method; 
                  we obtain a mean-square strong convergence of order 1/2 and a weak convergence of order 1.
                  Finally, the model and  the numerical scheme are implemented in an industrial CFD code (Code_Saturne)
                  and they are used to study the orientational and rotational behaviour of anisotropic inertia-free particles in a turbulent channel flow. 
                  The stochastic Lagrangian model for the orientation in the CFD code reproduces with some limits the orientation and
                  rotation statistics of the DNS. The results obtained on the orientation and rotation of aspherical particles in turbulence 
                  give new insight into large scale motions both, in two-dimensional space of interest for geophysical flows, and in three-dimensional industrial applications.

  title        = {Turbulent Drag Reduction by superhydrophobic surfaces},
  abstract     = {The superhydrophobic surfaces (SHSs) were initially inspired by the unique 
                  water-repellent properties of the lotus leaf and can be employed to produce drag reduction in 
                  turbulent flows. The effects of a SHS consist on micro-grooves which can entrap gas pockets 
                  when sub-merged in the water, i.e. at the groove an interface liquid-gas with a no zero velocity is 
                  present. In this work, direct numerical simulations (DNS) are used to investigate the drag-reducing 
                  performance of SHS in a turbulent pipe flow. The configuration of SHS influences the drag 
                  reduction within the pipe. The drag appears reduced in the SHS cases with respect to the smooth 
                  classical case. This effect strongly depends on the geometrical features of the surfaces. The 
                  increase of drag reduction is remarkable in the cases with a large groove width. To understand the 
                  phenomena linked to this mechanism, the turbulent vortical structures are studied. These last are 
                  significantly modified compared to the smooth case. The result obtained in this work underlines that 
                  the contribution of the Reynolds stress within the pipe rises with the width of groove, providing a 
                  negative contribution to the drag reduction. This effect is exceeded by the contribution of the slip 
                  velocity at the wall. SHS technology represents an emergent application in many fields of research 
                  and in a broad spectrum of industrial and everyday life applications.},

  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
