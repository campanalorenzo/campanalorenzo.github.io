I'm a curious and motivated PhD student interested in open questions about the physics of fluids. I afford each problem with a highly analytical  
attitude. Furthermore, I got passionate about the mathematical aspects of developing physical models and how these are constrained to the physical 
description. My expertise includes turbulence, stochastic processes, numerical scheme and programming. I enjoy learning new topics and shear ideas 
on relevant problems to reach a common goal in team working spirit.


I defended my [PhD thesis]({{site.url}}/assets/pdf/PhdThesis_Campana_Lorenzo.pdf) entitled "Stochastic modelling of non-spherical particles in turbulence" in March 2022 
under the supervision of [Mireille Bossy](http://www-sop.inria.fr/members/Mireille.Bossy/).
